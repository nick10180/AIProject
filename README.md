# AIProject

This project is a lightweight static web client that communicates with a chat completion API. It uses jQuery and Bootstrap&nbsp;5 for ease of maintenance and provides a simple conversational interface.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser. Enter a message and press **Submit** to talk with the assistant. The page sends your conversation history to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/v1/chat/completions` and displays the reply.

Ensure an API compatible with the endpoint above is running locally before using the client.
