# AIProject

This project is a very small local web application that sends text to a chat completion API and displays the response.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in your browser. Enter a message and click **Submit**. The client will send a POST request to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/v1/chat/completions` and display the reply in the page.

Make sure that an API compatible with the endpoint above is running on your machine.
